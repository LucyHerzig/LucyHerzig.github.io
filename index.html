     </ul>
     <p>This non existant country,has a big variety of religions and historical buildings you can go visit. Though you should be careful, since the ones guarding those buildings are cannibals and will eat you if you look ugly to them. (Good Luck)
     <p> Apart from that, bromeliacealandia is a really nice place to visit if you fancy some cold weathers or if you like pineapple.
     <p id="Pineapple"> This distinguished country is named after a legend about an old man eating a pineapple whilest he saved the country.

        <h3>
           Reasons to visit Sri Lanka
           
        </h3>
        <p> The tropical climate, beautiful beaches and incredible food of Sri Lanka are just some of the many reasons to include the South Asian country on your travel wish list. ... Sri Lanka is a great place to visit for water sport and wildlife enthusiasts and a haven for history buffs.</p>

    <p class="Prices"> The price of this travelling experience would be just 59,99 US dollars...
    <p id="miaw"> not enough money for me...</p>
